# My Journey in Programming

My programming journey began during my Telecommunications degree. At first, it felt like an alien language, but that mystery sparked my curiosity. Once I started understanding it, learning **C** was like playing a video-game ,music on, relaxing, and experimenting with small projects. I created a calculator, an ATM system, a Pascal Pyramid... which taught me about efficient coding and problem-solving.

I soon realized programming was my passion. I switched paths to pursue a degree focused solely on software development, where I delved deeper into web design, database management, and app development on computers and mobiles.

During this time, I worked weekends at a high-end restaurant, Totó and Tatel, learning teamwork, leadership, and client relations. Inspired by that experience, I even brainstormed ideas for my projects based on the organisation and requirements of the restaurant,

I received a scholarship at Applus, a partner company of Orange, where I learned about the management and distribution of work across different sectors, as well as how everything was organized through meetings in which I also participated, and the company's future projects. During my time there, I developed the data sampling table using Vue.js, which you can find in my projects. It proved to be very useful for them, as it replaced the simple and outdated version they were previously accustomed to.

This journey has been both challenging and rewarding, and I’m excited to continue exploring the infinite possibilities of programming!

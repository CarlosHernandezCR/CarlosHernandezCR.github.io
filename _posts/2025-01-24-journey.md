# My Journey in Programming

My programming journey began during my Telecommunications degree. At first, it felt like an alien language, but that mystery sparked my curiosity. Once I started understanding it, learning **C** was like playing a video-game ,music on, relaxing, and experimenting with small projects. I created a calculator, an ATM system, a Pascal Pyramid... which taught me about efficient coding and problem-solving.

I soon realized programming was my passion. I switched paths to pursue a degree focused solely on software development, where I delved deeper into web design, database management, and app development.

During this time, I worked weekends at a high-end restaurant, learning teamwork, leadership, and client relations. Inspired by that experience, I even brainstormed ideas for improving restaurant operations through technology.

This journey has been both challenging and rewarding, and Iâ€™m excited to continue exploring the infinite possibilities of programming!
